                    </h4> My name is Daniel and my current goal is to move to NYC to live and work. If you're looking for a valuable asset to add to your team, look no further.
                    <br>
                    <br> I am an amateur software developer and I'm always learning everyday. I have a solid foundation in the sciences and math as I've always found these topics greatly fascinating due to their nature of having a soft ceiling.
                    <br> I enjoy getting up and getting going, I have a knack for staying active. If I'm not solving a problem I feel like I am not being productive with my life. I've worked in various high stress, fast paced environments that have problems
                    that require immediate attention. I am a firm believer that a proper amount of stress or urgency keeps people motivated and active.
                    <br>
                    <br> A glimpse into my personal life: I am single, have no kids or pets and love to travel. I am easy going and easy to get along with. In my free time I like to work on creative projects. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
