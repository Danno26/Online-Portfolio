                    <br>To obtain a career where I can apply my math, science and problem solving background in helping people with their future endeavors and assist them to better their lives knowledge in math and science. I am bilingual and customer
                    services oriented and enjoy working with people.

                    <br> I am an amateur software developer and I'm always learning everyday. I have a solid foundation in the sciences and math as I've always found these topics greatly fascinating due to their nature of having a soft ceiling.
                    <br> I enjoy getting up and getting going, I have a knack for staying active. If I'm not solving a problem I feel like I am not being productive with my life. I've worked in various high stress, fast paced environments that have problems
                    that require immediate attention. I am a firm believer that a proper amount of stress or urgency keeps people motivated and active.
                    <br>As a self-taught developer I am looking for a place where I can compound on my current knowledge and grow.
                    <br>My professional goals are simple â€“ to become a part of a great organization and team where all my skills and talents are utilized to the fullest and to assist in my professional and personal growth whilst being challenged to always
                    strive for better.
